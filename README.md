# SampletsGP

SampletsGP leverages Samplets to compute Gaussian Processes for large datasets in low-dimensional spaces. The algorithms were developed as part of my Master's thesis at the University of Cologne.

# Installation

These algorithms are designed for Linux-based environments, as they depend on the FMCA library, which is configured for such systems. On a Windows machine, a Linux-like environment can be set up using a virtual machine. You can add this package by entering the following code in the ```julia``` terminal:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/mneugeb/SampletsGP")
```
The FMCA library is designed for use in Python. To interface with it in Julia, we rely on the ```PyCall``` package. Additionally, the ```FMCA.so``` file must be accessible to Python through PyCall. To achieve this, users should place the  ```FMCA.so``` file in a directory where Python can locate it. 

The provided ```FMCA.so``` build includes kernel functions not present in the original library. This is due to the original libraryâ€™s lack of support for custom kernels and its limited set, which omits some necessary ones. Therefore, the provided ```FMCA.so``` file is essential, and the code will not work with any other build.

# Example
Here is a short Example:
```julia
using SampletsGP, Plots, Random

# Define data
N = 20000
X_train = reshape(collect(range(-0.9, 0.9, length=N)), N, 1)
X_pred = reshape(collect(range(-0.9, 0.9, length=100)), 100, 1)
y_train = 2 .* X_train .* sin.(4 .* X_train.^2) .* cos.(4 .* X_train.^3) + randn(N)

# Define a GaussianProcess model
model = GaussianProcess()

# Train the model by optimizing the kernel hyperparameters five times
train!(model, X_train, y_train, 5)

# Make predictions using the GP model
y_pred, std_pred = predict!(model, X_pred, true)

# Define the true function (without noise)
f(x) = 2 .* x .* sin.(4 .* x.^2) .* cos.(4 .* x.^3)

# Plot the confidence intervals, true function, and posterior GP mean
plot(X_pred, y_pred .- 1.96 .* std_pred, fillrange = y_pred .+ 1.96 .* std_pred, fillalpha=0.5, label="95% confidence interval", lw=0, color=:cyan, ylims=(-1, 1))
plot!(X_pred, f(X_pred), label="True Function", color="red", lw = 3, title="Gaussian Process Regression via Samplets", xlabel="x", ylabel="y", legendfont=font(9), tickfont=font(9))
plot!(X_pred, y_pred, label="Posterior GP Mean", color="blue", lw = 3)
annotate!((0.8, 0.9, text("N=$N", :black, 12)))
